  <h2>What Ge’ez Stands For</h2>
  <p>
    The name <strong>Ge’ez</strong> signifies "the beginning"—a fitting symbol for our vision to lead a new era in biotechnology. At Ge’ez Bio, we are committed to pioneering the local production of high-quality enzymes, bio-based fertilizers, and eco-friendly pesticides that are safe for both human health and the planet.
    As import costs soar and demand continues to rise, we believe Ethiopia is ready to embrace a homegrown biotech movement—one driven by science, sustainability, and self-reliance. Ge’ez Bio is here to help shape that future.

<section id="about">
  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>Our journey began with a shared concern: the undeniable harm that chemical-based fertilizers and pesticides are causing to both human health and the environment. We couldn’t look away from the long-term damage—soil degradation, water contamination, and the growing health risks tied to the food we consume.
With Lydia’s background in medicine and Melaku’s in biochemistry, we found a natural synergy. Together, we envisioned a more holistic approach—one that protects human well-being, nourishes the earth, and uplifts local communities.
Ge’ez Bio was born from that vision: a commitment to creating safe, and effective alternatives. We believe that healthy food starts with healthy soil, and that true progress must be rooted in science, sustainability, and a deep respect for life. Our work is not just about replacing chemicals—it’s about restoring balance and dignity to the way we grow, eat, and live.
</p>

  <p>
    We are scientists, farmers, engineers, and dreamers. Every product we release is not just a formula—it’s a small piece of a larger mission: to give Ethiopia control over what it grows, builds, and exports. Our journey is just beginning, and we invite you to be part of it.
